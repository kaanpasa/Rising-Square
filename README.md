Computer Graphics Project
It is my project for Computer Graphics lecture.
It is a simple game.
Your goal is reaching to the finish line.
You use arrow keys for movement.
Once you start to move you can't stop.
You have 3 points at start and your main goal is reaching 10.
If you run out for points, you lose.
When you touch an enemy they are getting slower.
When you pass the finish line enemies getting faster.
Good luck.
